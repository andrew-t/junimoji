# Junimoji

[Junimoji](https://twitter.com/junimojis) are a puzzle invented by [Friz Frizzle](https://twitter.com/frizfrizzle).

The clues tell you what letters are in each subgrid, and are in order. The aim is to build up a valid crossword grid. (All valid words, no phrases, no two-letter words, everything should join up, the grid should be rotationally symmetrical. Standard crossword checking rules don't apply, so a nine-letter word might only cross one other entry — that's not allowed in a real crossword because you'd never get enough letters to solve the clue, but that's not an issue here.)

[Play the example](https://github.andrewt.net/junimoji/#3,3,3,3,README,LITN,YCAUMUD,EPSATT,UIRIN,DCALHY,EGGEAMS,FILE,UNRNCE).

# Using this tool

[Open the tool](https://github.andrewt.net/junimoji/).

## Setting

Enter the dimensions of the grid, leave the checkbox empty, and hit start. Click the grid, and use the arrow keys to move. Type letters into the boxes, use backspace to empty a box and space to make it black (or stop it being black). The clues will appear on the right hand side. Click "link to solve" to get a playable version.

The tool won't check your words are real or that the grid follows the rules but will handle the rotation for you.

## Solving from scratch

As above, but you have to type the clues yourself before you start.

The tool won't check your words are real, that you have the solution the setter intended, or that the grid follows the rules but will handle the rotation for you and will cross off clues where all the letters have been entered validly.

## Solving from a link

As above, but the initial form is bypassed and the clues are entered for you. You can generate links with the setting tool or just type them in, the format is fairly easily deciphered.
